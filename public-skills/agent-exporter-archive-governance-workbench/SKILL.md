# agent-exporter Archive Governance Workbench

Use this skill when an agent needs to attach the local `agent-exporter` bridge
from a repo checkout and operate the archive/retrieval/governance workflow
through a host-native packet.

## When This Skill Is The Right Tool

Use this packet when the task sounds like:

- "wire the local bridge from a repo checkout"
- "prove the bridge on a safe first-success path"
- "read archive / retrieval / governance lanes through a host packet"

Do **not** use this packet as a substitute for the flagship product story.

## What this skill teaches

- how to attach the local stdio MCP bridge
- how to prove the bridge on a safe first-success path
- how to publish a local archive shell
- how to save local retrieval reports
- how to read governance evidence without pretending there is a hosted platform

## Product truth

- `agent-exporter` is an archive and governance workbench
- the current primary surface is still the quickstart path
- this public skill packet is a secondary public lane
- the bridge exposes read-mostly archive, retrieval, and governance tools
- the browser pages organize proof; they do not execute retrieval or onboarding

## Current registry truth

- `ClawHub`: `listed-live`
  - fresh read-back: `clawhub inspect agent-exporter-archive-governance-workbench --no-input`
- `Goose Skills Marketplace`: `review-pending`
  - submission ref: `https://github.com/block/agent-skills/pull/24`
- `agent-skill.co source repo`: `platform-not-accepted-yet`
  - submission ref: `https://github.com/heilcheng/awesome-agent-skills/pull/180`
- `OpenHands/extensions`: `closed-not-accepted`
  - submission ref: `https://github.com/OpenHands/extensions/pull/162`
  - maintainer note: distribute a custom `marketplace.json` instead of expecting an upstream listing
- `awesome-opencode`: `exact_blocker_with_fresh_evidence`
  - exact blocker: this packet is a host-native skill folder for an archive/governance workbench, not an honest opencode-native project/resource entry today

## First-success flow

1. Follow `references/INSTALL.md` and wire the bridge from a repo checkout.
2. Call `integration_evidence_policy_list` to prove the bridge can answer a
   no-risk governance read.
3. If you have a workspace with transcript HTML receipts, call
   `publish_archive_index` on that workspace.
4. Only after the bridge works, move to retrieval or evidence comparison.

## Route Map

| If you need to... | Open / use this next |
| --- | --- |
| wire the bridge | `references/INSTALL.md` |
| verify the bridge safely | `references/DEMO.md` |
| see capability scope | `references/CAPABILITIES.md` |
| troubleshoot attach or host issues | `references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` |

## Preferred evidence order

1. `references/INSTALL.md`
2. `references/DEMO.md`
3. `references/CAPABILITIES.md`
4. `references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## Example prompts

- "Wire the local agent-exporter bridge and show me the available governance policies."
- "Publish the archive shell for this workspace and tell me where the archive shell landed."
- "Run semantic retrieval for this workspace and save a local report."
- "Compare two saved integration evidence snapshots and explain the readiness delta."

## Truth language

- Good: "local stdio bridge"
- Good: "secondary public lane"
- Good: "archive and governance workbench"
- Forbidden: "hosted platform"
- Forbidden: "listed-live skill" without fresh host read-back
- Forbidden: "full CLI exposed through MCP"
